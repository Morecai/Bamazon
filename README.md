# Bamazon
## The objective is to create an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

### Challenge: CustomerView
#### Goals:
1. Create a MySQL Database called Bamazon.
2. Then create a Table inside of that database called Products.
3. The products table should have each of the following columns:
* item_id (unique id for each product)
* product_name (Name of product)
* department_name
* price (cost to customer)
* stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)
